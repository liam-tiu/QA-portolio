# QA Portfolio by Liam Tiu

Welcome! This is my personal Quality Assurance (QA) portfolio — a place where I document my learning journey and practice core QA skills.

## 📌 About This Repo

This repository is a **work in progress** as I build hands-on experience in manual QA and gradually learn automation tools like Selenium or Playwright.

I’ll be posting:
- Sample test cases 🧾
- Bug reports 🐛
- Usability or UI feedback 🎯
- Notes from tools or concepts I’m currently learning 📚

## 🎯 What is QA?

Quality Assurance (QA) is the process of making sure that software works **as expected**, is free of bugs, and provides a smooth experience for users. A QA tester:
- Finds issues before users do
- Thinks in edge cases and “what-ifs”
- Communicates clearly with both users and developers
- Helps improve product quality and trust

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a fresh graduate exploring the QA field. I enjoy thinking critically, spotting inconsistencies, and asking “what if?” in how systems behave.  
Although I’ve dabbled in different areas of IT, I’ve realized QA aligns with how I think — structured, skeptical, and detail-focused.

This repo is my way of tracking progress and showing what I know (and what I’m learning) — step by step.
